<h1>Cities</h1>
<div class="Paris">
<h2>Paris, France</h2>
<img src="Paris.jpg" alt="Picture of Paris">
<p>Paris has to be one of the places that I have always wanted to visit when I was younger. 
I actually have cousins who live in Paris and my cousin has always told me to come to France to visit him. 
This makes Paris one of the top cities that I want to visit. Plus, the way that Paris is portrayed in movies
and shows makes Paris seem like a really attractive place to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="Tokyo">
<h2>Tokyo, Japan</h2>
<img src="Tokyo.jpg" alt="Picture of Tokyo">
<p>Tokyo has always appealed to me when I was younger because I had this idea that ninjas lived in Japan. Now, I hear that Japan is one of the most 
technologically advanced places in the world. I love to see new inventions for a glimpse of what the future might be like and who knows? Maybe I might 
actually be able to meet a ninja</p>
</div>
<div class="LosAngeles">
<h2>Los Angeles, California</h2>
<img src="LosAngeles.jpg" alt="Picture of Los Angeles">
<p>Los Angeles is just one of the places I HAVE to go. Located also here in America, it would not make much sense if I wasnt to go out and vsit LA.
I have always wanted to visit Hollywood as a child due to all the great stuff I hear about Hollywood being the center of all celebrities. I have also
always wanted to see that big Hollywood sign in person, maybe even stand right next to it.</p>
