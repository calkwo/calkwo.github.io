<h1 align="center">The Story of Calvin Kwok</h1>

<p class="bio" id="general">
My name is Calvin Kwok. I was born on the twenty-second of March in the year two-thousand-and-one. I went to elementary school in P.S.1 for Pre-K and Kindergarten, 
then transferred to P.S.173 for First Grade to Fifth Grade. I went to middle school in M.S.216, otherwise known as George J. Ryan middle school. Currently, I am a
sophomore at the Bronx High School of Science.

<p class="bio" id="hobby">
In my freetime, depending on the weather, I typically go outside to my elementary school's park to play basketball with my friends. On days with poor weather, I 
would stay at home and play video games.
