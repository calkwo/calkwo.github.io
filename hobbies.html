basketball, video games, television

In my freetime, I like to meet up with friends to go outside and play basketball. I either go to my elementary school's (P.S.173's) 
park or a recreation center. I typically go to my elementary school's park because it is near my house. However, I like to go to the 
farther park in the recreation center because it has an indoor basketball court and the floor is flat whereas P.S.173's basketball 
court is outdoors and the floor is slightly slanted.  

However, on days with bad weather, being unable to go outside, I am on my computer playing video games.

	<td>However, on days with bad weather, being unable to go outside, I am on my computer playing video games. I personally enjoy the way that
	video games are able to challenge my reflexes. Playing video games also allow me to live in a fantasy where I have magic powers.</td>
	<td>On bad weather days, contrary to popular belief, video games do get boring. When this happens, I am typically watching TV shows. Some of my favorites 
	include Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl, Iron Fist, and Agents of Shield (you can see that I love superheroes). Sometimes, I get on my
	computer and watch shows with my friends. My friends and I would both get on a call in Skype and then watch the TV show or movie together. Being able to
	talk with someone while watching a show or movie definitely makes the watching experience a lot more fun. </td>
